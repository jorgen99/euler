# Project euler
https://projecteuler.net/archives

The idea is to solve some problems to brush up on some form of skills 
I've had in ruby and python and hopefully learning new stuff in go and 
haskell.

My plan was to do batches of say five problems in python and then do 
them again in the other three languages.
